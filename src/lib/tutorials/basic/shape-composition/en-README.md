# Shape Composition

Complex images are often built by **combining masks**. Here you will:

- Create a rectangle mask with `step`
- Create a circle mask with `smoothstep`
- Combine them using `max` (union)

## Exercise

1. Build `rectMask` for a centered rectangle
2. Build `circleMask` for a circle
3. Combine with `max(rectMask, circleMask)`
4. Mix background/foreground colors
