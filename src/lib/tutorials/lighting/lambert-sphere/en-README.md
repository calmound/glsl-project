# Lambert Lighting (Sphere)

Shade a sphere with Lambert diffuse lighting using an estimated normal.

## Learning Objectives
- Estimate a normal
- Compute diffuse term with dot(n,l)

## Exercise
- Compute diff = max(dot(n, lightDir), 0.0)
- Use diff to shade the sphere

## Hints
- Keep lightDir normalized
