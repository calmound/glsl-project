# Noise Functions

Learn various noise function implementations and applications as the foundation for procedural texture generation.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand characteristics of different noise function types
- Learn to implement basic noise algorithms from scratch
- Master noise function applications in texture generation

## Key Concepts

### Pseudo-Random Number Generation

Creating randomness in shaders:
```glsl
float random(vec2 st) {
    return fract(sin(dot(st.xy, vec2(12.9898,78.233))) * 43758.5453123);
}
```

### Value Noise

Interpolation based on random values at grid points:
1. Generate random values at grid points
2. Use bilinear interpolation for smooth transitions
3. Produces continuous noise fields

### Gradient Noise

Higher quality noise based on gradient vectors:
- Store gradient vectors at grid points
- Calculate distance vectors to grid points
- Use dot products and interpolation to generate noise

### Noise Applications

- **Texture Generation**: Wood grain, marble, clouds
- **Terrain Generation**: Height maps, erosion effects
- **Animation Effects**: Fire, water waves, particles

## Exercise

Implement a basic value noise function and use it to create organic textures.

### Hints

1. Start with a simple random function
2. Implement grid coordinate calculations
3. Generate random values at grid corners
4. Use smoothstep for interpolation
5. Combine multiple scales of noise

## Expected Result

You should see smooth organic textures with natural random variations that can serve as the foundation for various materials.
